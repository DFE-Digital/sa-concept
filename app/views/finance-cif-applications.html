      <p>Success rate is around 60% of all applications and the reasons for not being successful can include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a larger than expected number of applications competing for limited funding</li>
        <li>the quality of the applications</li>
        <li>applications that don't align to the priorities </li>
        <li>weak or little supporting evidence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is important that you read the guidance and supporting information before you start your application.</p>
